# Pong
Welcome to my very first Unity project ever, **Pong**!

## About
This game was my first project during the first year of my Software Development study at SintLucas Eindhoven.
As this was the very first game I had ever made, my assignment was to make pong in Unity.
This way I could focus on learning the basics of Unity.

## What You'll Find
- **Gameplay Elements:** You'll control a padel to bounce back the ball. Don't let the ball pass through your side!
- **Assignment Requirements:** I fulfilled specific criteria like creating a 2D game in Unity, recreating the original pong game in Unity and creating my own version of pong.

## How to Play
- **Controls:** Use WASD to move your padel.
- **Ball:** A ball will spawn at the center of the screen and move towards a random direction. If the ball passes behind your padel, the oponent receives a point and the ball respawns.
- **Score:** Be the first player to reach 10 points to win!

## Game modes
- **Player vs Computer:** Play against the experienced pong bot (unbeatable ðŸ˜„).
- **Player vs Player:** Compete against your friends for the win in a 1 vs 1 pong game.
- **2 Player Air Pong:** This is basically player vs player pong, but now players are able to move horizontally too!
